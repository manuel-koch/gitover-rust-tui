# Implementation ToDo for Gitover Rust TUI

This is a living document.
New tasks are added as needed.
Done tasks are check-marked when implemented.
Checkmarked tasks are removed on demand to merge them into `features.md`.

## Bugs

- [x] Pressing "left" keybinding to collapse current repo-section
      ( a repo-row is selected, not the section-title-row ), the selected repo is
      afterwards the same index in the list as before.
      But it would be better to select the repo-section-title-row instead that was just collapsed.

## UX Polish

- [ ] In the file-picker popup, apply the sorting-flag for paths.
      ( blocked: ratatui-explorer sorts internally, no API to override,
      see https://github.com/tatounee/ratatui-explorer/issues/22 )

## Git Rebase Operation

- [ ] Rebase onto trunk branch: run `git rebase <trunkbranch>`
      Auto-stash before rebase, pop stash after rebase completes
- [ ] Rebase controls when rebase is in progress: continue / skip / abort
